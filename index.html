      <p>Hi, I'm Lucas Neves, a tech enthusiast based in MaceiÃ³, Alagoas, Brazil. I have a deep passion for technology and economics, always seeking to explore the latest trends and innovations in both fields. When I'm not immersed in tech, you can find me enjoying video games or spending time with my family â€” my wonderful spouse and our beloved cat. With a keen interest in how technology shapes the world around us, Iâ€™m always learning and growing, eager to apply my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems.</p>

      <p>Brazil is the largest country in South America, home to over 215 million people, making it the sixth most populous country in the world. The population is incredibly diverse, reflecting a rich history of indigenous peoples, European colonization, African influence, and immigration from various parts of the globe, including Asia and the Middle East.

        Brazil is a young country, with a median age of around 33 years. The majority of Brazilians live in urban areas, with major cities like SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and BrasÃ­lia acting as economic, cultural, and political hubs. SÃ£o Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, is one of the most populous cities in the world with over 12 million residents.
        
        The ethnic composition of Brazil is a vibrant mix. Approximately 47% of Brazilians identify as White, largely of Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish descent. Around 43% identify as Pardo (mixed race), 9% as Black, and a smaller percentage as Asian or Indigenous. This diversity has led to a rich cultural tapestry, evident in Brazil's languages, traditions, and customs.
        
        Portuguese is the official language of Brazil, but the country is also home to hundreds of indigenous languages spoken by various native groups. While Roman Catholicism has historically been the dominant religion, Brazil is becoming more religiously diverse, with growing Protestant and Evangelical Christian communities.</p>
